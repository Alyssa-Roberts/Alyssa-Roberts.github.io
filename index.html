    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I am a second-year student majoring in Computer Engineering and Physics at Northeastern University on the Boston campus, 
      with an expected graduation in May 2028. I am part of the John Martinson Honors Program, which has encouraged me to explore 
      how my education and interests can create meaningful impact. <br><br>

      During my first year, I was a Global Scholar, spending my first two semesters abroad in Oakland, California and London, 
      United Kingdom. Studying across multiple locations strengthened my independence, adaptability, and sense of responsibility. <br><br>

      Outside of academics, I enjoy reading, traveling, and exploring the outdoors—especially hiking. I also love trying new foods 
      and have a strong appreciation for food in general.

    <div class="project-card">
      <img src="oop.png">
      <h3>Object-Oriented Game Design in C++</h3>
      <p><i>Designed and implemented a console-based Mastermind game using object-oriented programming principles in C++. The project emphasized 
        modular class design, clear game logic, and collaborative software development.</i></p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-card">
      <img src="watering.png">
      <h3>Autonomous Watering System</h3>
      <p><i>Built an Arduino-based automated watering system that monitored soil moisture and water levels to control a motor-driven pump. 
        The system provided real-time feedback to the user and prioritized efficient water use for household plants.</i></p>
