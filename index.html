    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I am a second-year student majoring in Computer Engineering and Physics at Northeastern University on the Boston campus, 
      with an expected graduation in May 2028. I am part of the John Martinson Honors Program, which has encouraged me to explore 
      how my education and interests can create meaningful impact. 

      During my first year, I was a Global Scholar, spending my first two semesters abroad in Oakland, California and London, 
      United Kingdom. Studying across multiple locations strengthened my independence, adaptability, and sense of responsibility. 

      Outside of academics, I enjoy reading, traveling, and exploring the outdoors—especially hiking. I also love trying new foods 
      and have a strong appreciation for food in general.
